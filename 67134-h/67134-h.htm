<h2><span class="smcap">Flavor in Milk and Its Products.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Flavor:<br />
How tested?</b></div>

<p>Good flavor sells milk, cream, butter and cheese;
poor flavor condemns them. Flavor is that indescribable
something, which, in good dairy products,
appeals pleasantly to our senses, but often
passes unnoticed because so familiar; in poor products it is
equally indescribable, but more often characterized in vigorous
language, when &#8220;frowzy&#8221; butter, &#8220;garlicy&#8221; milk, &#8220;bitter&#8221;
cream or &#8220;strong&#8221; cheese present their offensive odors and tastes.
The ordinary consumer calls flavor the &#8220;taste&#8221; of the article
which tickles his palate; but the expert knows that the nerves of
smell play the larger part, and he depends for his judgment largely
upon a trained nose. Hence we see the butter judge or cheese
scorer pass the trier beneath his nostrils with deep-drawn breath
and meditative study of the aroma which arises. Smells, however,
cannot be measured in degrees or separated into their elements
by the spectroscope; therefore we have to depend upon
general terms, often differing with the different experts, in our discussion
of flavor; yet we have some well-marked classes which
serve as a basis for reference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Faults of<br />
flavor<br />
classified.</b></div>

<p>We can separate the faulty flavors into classes by
their origin. The minute particles thrown off by
dairy products, whose impact upon tongue or nostrils
give rise to taste or smell, may come (1) from
compounds in the food of the cow or developed in
her body (2) from matters, other than germs, taken up by the
milk while it stands in poorly-ventilated stables or rooms reeking
with foul smells, or (3) from substances which are the direct or
indirect result of the activity of living organisms in the milk.</p>

<p>Odors of the first class will be most noticeable while the milk is
warm from the cow and will not increase with time. They are
really far less common than dairymen generally believe and may
be avoided almost entirely by careful feeding. Garlic, turnips,
cabbage and such &#8220;fragrant&#8221; edibles will, of course, taint the
milk if they are fed within a few hours before milking; but when
fed soon after the cows are milked, the volatile oils to which these
odors are due will generally disappear from the animal&#8217;s system
before the next morning or evening.</p>

<p>Too often odors of the second class are assigned to the first, and
the old cow takes the blame for man&#8217;s fault; as milk very readily
and quickly takes up smells and tastes from its surroundings.
When the owner delivers milk to the factory and is told that it
&#8220;smells bad,&#8221; he forgets that he or his men let it stand in the
uncleaned stable to draw in the &#8220;cowy&#8221; and worse odors, while
the cows were being fed and some other chores attended to; or
that they poured it into pails that lacked a little of perfect sweetness;
and he immediately says; &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to stop feeding silage.&#8221;
&#8220;The cows ate some cabbage trimmings last night,&#8221; or, &#8220;Someone
forgot to close the rye-field gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Odors of these two classes, due to volatile compounds in the
milk, are of most importance in the milk and cream trade, as the
faults largely disappear in making butter and cheese. Thorough
&aelig;ration is often helpful in the removal of such flavors.</p>

<p>Odors of the third class, except in some very rare cases where
the udder itself is the seat of colonies of bacteria, are not observed
in freshly-drawn milk. The bacteria, molds and yeasts which
cause them must have a chance to develop and to set up chemical
changes in the milk; and this rarely occurs to any great extent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
within 12 hours from the time the milk is drawn. A high temperature,
however, is favorable to growth of these low forms of
plant life; so in warm weather milk faults are common. In
butter-making, and in cheese-making, also, the heat often used to
ripen the cream and the high temperature at which the milk is
held in &#8220;setting&#8221; and &#8220;cooking&#8221; the curd, furnish conditions
very favorable to the germs present and they develop with great
rapidity. In their growth part of the milk is used for food and in
its breaking down into simpler compounds the aromatic substances
which make flavor, good or bad, are formed.</p>

<p>The flavor of good milk and cream, then, is an inherent quality
due to the normal constituents of the milk; the flavors of butter,
both good and bad, except that due to the fat and to odors
absorbed by the milk, are held to be the result of bacterial action;
the fundamental flavors of cheese are probably due to chemical
decomposition, started by unorganized ferments known as enzyms;
joined with which are other flavors marking the individual
cheeses, which are probably due to bacteria; and it has recently
been found that in some cases yeasts have been the cause of bad
flavor.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap">Fishy Flavor in Milk.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Ready<br />
Relief.</b></div>

<p>This peculiar smell, as though the milk had set in
a close room with a barrel of not-too-fresh fish,
was brought to the attention of the Bacteriologist
by a dealer who had already located it as coming
from the milk of a certain dairy. The dairyman is a more than
ordinarily careful milk-handler, who gladly co&ouml;perated with the
Station in efforts to locate the trouble in his herd. Bottles were
supplied by the Bacteriologist, which had been steamed to insure
the death of all germ life and then sealed. These sealed bottles
were taken by the dairyman to his farm; at milking time each
was opened long enough to receive a little milk from each quarter
of the udder of a single cow; and then re-sealed. All were
brought to the Station; and, upon examination, the odor was
found only in the milk of one cow. The owner rejected her milk
and heard no further complaint, from the dealer, of bad smells.
This was the practical point; and it was thus easily and simply
gained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Cause not<br />
found.</b></div>

<p>From the scientist&#8217;s standpoint, though, only a
beginning had been made; the real cause of the
trouble was as yet unknown; nor was any satisfactory
solution reached even after a long investigation.
The flavor could hardly come from the food, for all the
cows were fed alike and no objectionable weeds were found in
their pasture. The cow seemed perfectly healthy and no evidence
of inflammation or disease could be found on the udder or in the
milk. Neither could any form of bacteria be found in the milk,
which, in cultures or introduced into the udder of a healthy cow,
would reproduce the fishy smell.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Rare fault.</b></div>

<p>At least two other cases of similar flavor have
been known; but no cause was evident in either
case. The trouble is very infrequent, at worst,
and is here discussed mainly to show how easily a trouble due to
one cow can be located by taking individual samples of the milk;
and how cheaply gotten rid of by leaving out the objectionable
product.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap">Bitter Flavor in Neufchatel Cheese.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote"><b>An uncompleted<br />
study.</b></div>

<p>A little better result than that in the study of fishy
flavor was reached in the investigation of a bitter
flavor in Neufchatel cheese; but this study also
had to be left incomplete. The trouble in the
factory was easily remedied; and the germ responsible for the outbreak
was obtained in pure culture; but full study of the fault in
all its bearings was hindered by the refusal of the herd owner to
admit that the trouble was due to his milk. The investigation
had to stop with the guilty herd; it did not locate the original
source of infection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Method of<br />
detection.</b></div>

<p>This bitter flavor is not the same as the bitterness
quite common in milk and cream at certain seasons of
the year; as the milk itself tasted and smelled all
right until well along in the process of cheese-making
when the curd was being &aelig;rated and drained. The flavor
was noticed in the factory in October and could not be checked,
though the maker took great pains to wash and scald all his utensils
and everything which touched the milk after it came from the
farm. To locate the trouble, samples were taken of the milk of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
each patron and the cheese-making process started with each
sample. In 18 hours all the samples of curd appeared normal
but two, which were gassy and bad-smelling; and one of these,
when drained and exposed to the air, showed a pronounced bitter
flavor. This sample proved to be from the dairy which had furnished
the milk for making the Neufchatel, a milk specially
selected because of its high fat-content. This furnished direct
proof that the fault lay in the milk, not in its factory handling;
and rejection of this milk ended the trouble in the Neufchatel.
As already stated, the study could not be carried into the herd to
see whether one cow, wrong stable surroundings, a stagnant pool
of water or contaminated dairy utensils were to blame for the
trouble in the factory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Bacteria<br />
blamable.</b></div>

<p>Samples of this faulty milk were taken for laboratory
study and various bacteria and molds were
separated. This was done by diluting the milk
with a sterilized fluid so that the germs were
quite widely separated when the milk was poured out in flat glass
dishes. Each kind of germ is marked by some peculiarity of
growth which makes it possible to distinguish between them; and
pure cultures can be made by transferring a little of the growing
colony to a new dish of sterilized agar, gelatin or other material
suited to germ life. From these pure cultures fresh milk from the
Station herd was inoculated and small Neufchatel cheeses made.
No bitter flavor was noticed in similar check cheeses; and the
milk containing only one of the forms of germ life found produced
bitter cheese. The bitterness, as in the factory, was noticed only
after the curd was drained and &aelig;rated. Soft, poorly-drained curd
was free from the flavor though well inoculated with the short
bacillus which produced the bad flavor in well-dried curd. This
shows that the germ is one which requires exposure to the air to
develop the bitter compound in the cheese. Unfortunately this
germ, when cultivated in milk for some time lost the power of
producing bitter cheese, so the investigation came to an end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span></p>


<h2><span class="smcap">Sweet Flavor in Cheddar Cheese.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote"><b>A new cause<br />
of cheese<br />
faults.</b></div>

<p>By methods similar to those just given the cause
of the common and costly cheese fault known as
&#8220;sweet flavor&#8221; has probably been found. This
investigation was demanded by the occurrence in
some of the best-conducted factories of outbreaks
of the trouble which most thorough cleansing and scalding fail to
overcome. It is believed that these attacks result in annual loss
to the State of at least $10,000. The trouble is of obscure origin
and is peculiar in its development, manifesting itself in flavors of
varying intensity and character, from a faint sweetness to a well-marked
fruity smell and taste, and seeming to appear and disappear
without rule or method. This made study more difficult than
in the case of well-defined troubles; but its manner of development
in the cheese indicated some living germ as the cause; so the attempt
at solution of the problem was made from that standpoint.</p>

<p>By cultural methods, study was made of the flora of good and
poor cheeses; that is, the various forms of plant life existing in
these cheeses were separated from each other and their forms, actions
and effects noted. These forms of life were mostly bacteria
and yeasts; and, contrary to the usual rule, it was the latter
which finally seemed to demand attention.</p>

<p>Yeasts are plants a little higher in the scale of life than
bacteria, a little larger but still microscopic, and differing from
bacteria in their mode of reproduction, which is by budding of a
new cell from an old one rather than by division of an old cell into
two new ones of equal size. Their most characteristic action is
the formation of alcohol and carbon dioxide; which makes them
indispensable in brewing and bread making.</p>

<p>In good cheeses almost no yeasts were found, but in the sweet-flavored
cheeses sometimes half of the germs present were yeasts;
and they were always found where the sweet flavor was noticed.
Yeasts have not been recognized, hitherto, as a cause for such
cheese faults; but their presence in such numbers cast strong
suspicion upon them; which actual work proved to be well
founded, for pronounced cases of sweet flavor developed in cheeses
made from pure milk inoculated with the yeasts; and the vat in
which the cheese was made became contaminated so that, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
further intentional inoculation, sweet-flavored cheese was produced
where none had been known before. As yeasts have
hitherto played minor parts in dairy investigations, no classification
of those found has yet been made, nor has the exact flavor due
to each one been determined. Further study is being given to
the subject.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap">Rusty Spot in Cheddar Cheese.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Not a flavor.</b></div>

<p>Rusty spot is not a flavor trouble, as spotted
cheeses of this kind may be all right in taste and
smell. The spots, however, are offensive to the
eye and render the cheese salable only at a reduction in price, if
at all. From the Station investigations, continued for nearly two
years, along much the same lines as the flavor studies but with a
little more definite guide in color than in taste and smell, some
direct knowledge has been gained, though not as definite as could
be desired along preventive and remedial lines.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Cause and<br />
conditions.</b></div>

<p>The rusty spots are colonies of minute plants,
bacteria, growing on the walls of the air spaces
within the cheese. The trouble usually appears
in May, often does little harm during the middle
of the summer and generally disappears in October. In cheese
made with a high acid content the moisture content of the air
spaces within the cheese is low, and without abundance of moisture
the germs make little growth; hence the spots are too small
to be noticed. The marked influence, on the germs of rusty spot,
of this slight variation in the character of the cheese probably
accounts for the unexpected appearance and disappearance of
the spots from cheeses of an occasional day&#8217;s make in infected
factories.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Cure.</b></div>

<p>Where the spots are not too large or too plentiful,
giving the cheese a good high color covers up the
rustiness so that it is not noticeable. To get
entirely rid of the trouble has bothered some of the best cheese-makers,
aided by good advisers; but plenty of hot water followed
by a liberal use of live steam on vats, cans and working utensils
should give good results.</p>

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
